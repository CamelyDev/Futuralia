//Blocks save/compress method
//- Blocks are saved, but separated by chunks (blocks0-1.ini for chunk X0)
//- 48 blocks for every chunk (meaning 114 bytes avg X 48)
//- Every chunkname is saved in chunks.ini, indicating where it should load the corresponding blockX.ini
//- Use buffers with type buffer_grow to store the chunk in blocks and compress it (12288 bytes approx)

//Blocks load/uncompress method
//- First load chunks.ini and run a for loop with the size of the world / chunksize
//- Every loop:
//	- read the chunk value
//	- load the corresponding blocks file
//	- uncompress buffer and read
//	- add to blocks array
