MANUAL:
	1. Block System
		- To use the block system, you will need to provide 1 sprite with sub images containing all the different blocks
		(IMPORTANT: MUST BE THE SAME SIZE AND YOU CAN USE MULTIPLE SPRITES TO CATEGORIZE, ALWAYS THE SAME BLOCK SIZE)
		- To create a block, you will need a controller object (like oTest included in the package). Inside the controller object:
			1. An array (array_create(-1))
			2. Create event with all the blocks (test = new block(spr,img,etc...))
		- When creating a block, make sure the variable is NOT local. Doing so will make the block dissapear out of nowhere.
		- To refer to the block, ALWAYS call the variable you made the block in.
	2. Other systems
		- It's literally the same as the block system but with different options. Same thing but with another taste.
And yeah that's it lol
