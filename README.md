# Futuralia
A mining simulator game made in GMS2, with a psychological horror twist (that, sadly, hasn't been implemented yet).
The game consists of five main habits you need to teach to the character. These consists of:
1. Mining
2. Obtaining stuff, gaining XP (and selling it in future updates)
3. Gaining strength
4. The rebirth system
5. Smiling

(some are not implemented yet)

# Roadmap

1. Implement the level system and the rebirthing system, so it actually converts into a "mining simulator"
2. Implement the "market" system, so you can sell ores to gain money
3. Fully implement a modding system, so you can add your own ores and community blocks
4. Make the horror twist
5. Possibly release this on itch.io
