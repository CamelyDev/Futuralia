# Futuralia
A mining simulator "tycoon" game made in GMS2, with a psychological horror twist (that, sadly, hasn't been implemented yet).
The game consists of five main habits you need to teach to the character. These consists of:
1. Mining
2. Obtaining stuff and selling it
3. Gaining strength
4. The rebirth system
5. Smiling

(these are not implemented yet LOL)

# Roadmap

1. Implement the level system and the rebirthing system, so it actually converts into a tycoon game (lol)
2. Fully implement a modding system, so you can add your own ores and community blocks
3. Make the horror twist
4. Possibly release this on itch.io
